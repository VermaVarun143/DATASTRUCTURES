📚 Data Structures and Algorithms in C/C++
Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This project contains well-organized, tested, and easy-to-understand implementations of common data structures and algorithms written in C and C++.

 Overview
This repository aims to provide:

1.Clear and concise implementations for learning, reference, and practice.

2.A variety of data structures (like stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (such as sorting and searching).

3.Modular, commented, and beginner-friendly code.

4.Code for academic use, interviews, and competitive programming preparation.
